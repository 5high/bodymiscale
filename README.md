EN :

The purpose of this custom integration is to have additional information when weighing yourself with a smart scale like Xiaomi Mi Scale.
For example you can use [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) or [BLE monitor](https://github.com/custom-components/ble_monitor) to collect the required data via Bluetooth.

Information about the unit of measurement. All calculations are made using the unit of measurement KG. If your scale is set in lbs don't worry Bodymiscale will convert for you. If you want to display your data in lbs you can use the card here [lovelace-body-miscale-card](https://github.com/dckiller51/lovelace-body-miscale-card). Just click on Convert kg to lbs.

The generated data is :

- Weight
- Height
- Years
- Gender
- Bmi
- Basal metabolism
- Visceral fat
- Ideal weight
- Bmi label
- Lean body mass \*
- Body fat \*
- Water \*
- Bone mass \*
- Muscle mass \*
- Fat mass ideal \*
- Protein \*
- Body type \*

\*: When also the impedance sensor is configured
